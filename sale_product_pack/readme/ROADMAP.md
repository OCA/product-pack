- If this module is installed and stock module is installed too, when
  you create a Sale order for a *Non detailed* Pack and you confirm it,
  a *Stock picking* is not created with the storable components of that
  Pack. So, add a new module called *sale_stock_product_pack* that adds
  that feature.
