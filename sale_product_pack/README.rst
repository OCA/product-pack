Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

#. Go to *Sales > Products > Products*, create or select a product and check
   *Is Pack?*
#. Set "Product type" and "Pack component price" fields in the *Pack* page.
#. Add the products to be included in it.
#. Go to *Sales > Orders > Quotations* and create a Quotation.
#. Add a product that has checked "Is Pack?"
#. Save data and you will see an specific behavior depending on "Pack type" and
   "Pack component price" fields options selected on this *Pack*. For example,
   for products that has *Detailed* option selected in "Pack type" field you
   will see one *sale order line* per component that belong to this Pack.
   (See *Product pack* module README.rst file)

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* If this module is installed and stock module is installed too, when you
  create a Sale order for a *Non detailed* Pack and you confirm it,
  a *Stock picking* is not created with the storable components of that Pack.
  So, add a new module called *sale_stock_product_pack* that adds that feature.
