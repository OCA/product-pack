This module allows you to define a product as a *Product Pack*. Each
*Product Pack* has a list of products that are part of this pack.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

#. Go to *Sales > Products > Products*, create a product and set "Is Pack?".
#. Set *Pack Type* and *Pack component price*.
#. Then choose the products to include in the pack.

`Product pack` is a base module for `sale_product_pack` and other modules that
needs to use packs. `Pack type` and `Pack component price` are used to define
the behavior that the packs will have when it is selected in the sales order
lines (if `sale_product_pack` module is installed).
The options of this field are the followings:

`Pack type`:

  * Detailed: It allows you to select an option defined in
    `Pack component price` field.
  * Non Detailed: Will not show the components information,
    only the pack product and the price will be the its price plus the sum of
    all the components prices.

`Pack component price`:

  * Detailed per component: will show each components and its prices,
    including the pack product itself with its price.
  * Totalized in main product: will show each component but will not show
    components prices. The pack product will be the only one that has price
    and this one will be its price plus the sum of all the components prices.
  * Ignored: will show each components but will not show
    components prices. The pack product will be the only one that has price
    and this one will be the price set in the pack product.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* It could add another *Pack Type* called maybe *merged* in *Packs*, in which
  the calculation of the related sale order line *Unit Price* is equal to
  *main product Pack price* + *sum of all its component*
* Make *product.pack.line* multi-company
